                    Every year, roughly one-third of the food produced for human consumption 
                    in the world - approximately 1.3 billion tonnes - is lost or wasted. So 
                    why not try to save some food and give it to someone who might need it 
                    or have a better use for it? I created this website to give back to the 
                    community and so that we can live in a world where there is no hunger, 
                    no poverty, and where we are sustainable and responsible without wasting 
                    resources.
